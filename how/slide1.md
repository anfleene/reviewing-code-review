General Tips for Reviewees

* Code Review is like peer editing a research paper.
* You are not your code, don't take review comments personaly.
* Don't take every suggestion as a mandate
* Be prepared to defend a decision
* Smaller Pull Requests are better. It is much easier to review ten 100-line PRs than one 1000-line review.
* Pre-review your code. Take a quick glance over your code and see if there’s anything you would push back on if you were reviewing this code and fix it before sending for review.

Tips for Code Reviewers

# Point out the good stuff
* Pointing out good code can be just as benificial to an engineer as
finding something wrong


# Don't be afraid to review changes to code you've never seen before
* Just because you aren't fimilar with the way something works doesn't
mean you aren't qualified to review a piece of code.
* Reviewing something new is a easy way to learn about that code

# Review in a timely manner
* It takes team-wide discipline to review in a timely manner
* Leting a PR get stale makes it harder to release

# Encourage discussion during review
* Asking why a particular code choice was made is often better than
dictating a change

# Devalue code, it's cheap
* Freshly-written code can be thrown out; it happens, it should happen.

# Favor Clarity over Cleverness
* Stop early if you don’t understand something. If you can’t understand it as reviewer, the next casual visitor to the code definitely won’t understand it.

# Don’t require perfection.
* Law of deminishing returns
* Code wants to be shipped

# Don't be afraid to seak another opinion
* Consult style guides [JavaScript](http://source.tstmedia.com/jsstyle)

* Bring in another developer
