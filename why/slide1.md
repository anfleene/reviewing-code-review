Reasons We Code Review

* Knowledge transfer among engineers.
* It makes engineer more conscious while writing code.
* Provides a mechanism to receive feedback to promote learning and improve code quality.
* Bugs found early on in program development are cheaper to fix
* Testing catches fewer bugs per hour than human inspection of code

Ambiguity in what needs to be reviewed could let something slide.
By explicitly setting the expectation, everythingâ€™s much simpler. Just get it reviewed.
